# Mental-Health-Academic-Performance-During-COVID-19

This respository is for the analysis I conducted to kickstart a project I led with 5 classmates in UCLA's Digital Humanities 101 course. Our final project will center on the potential impacts mental health had on academic performance during COVID-19 for students in Delhi, India. We will use this dataset as context for a greater analysis of COVID-19's impact on mental health and academic development around the world.
